> [!NOTE]
> Massive first commits were because I was working in another repo unintentionally, moved things over so it's massive chunks at once.
> The majority of the templating for the project was also auto generated so it's very large

> As of October 14th I've decided to just start over on the backend with better practice. It's simply not scalable and or set up properly.

# Capstone - Online Python IDE

Welcome! This is my capstone project, it's effectively a simplified [replit](https://replit.com/) clone, but just for python with a custom made linter.

## Setup (subject to change)

-   Backend: `cd backend` then `dotnet run`, or open the `.sln` file in `/backend` and run using `http`. (both create a /swagger page to test the API)
  -   `dotnet build` is required for a first time run
-   Frontend: `cd frontend` then `npm start`
  -   `npm install` is required for a first time run

> [!TODO]
> The `Tests` are currently not implemented, will update here once they're implemented.

## Frontend

The frontend is a react app, it's a single page app for the sake of simplicity and performance.
There's two main sections:
- The social media esque project browsing/favouriting
- Code writing/execution

For more details check the README [here]()

## Backend

The backend is a .NET Core API, it's a REST API that uses the `ASP.NET Core` framework. It's written in C# and uses `Dapper` for the ORM.
My linter is written in python and uses the built in `AST` to parse the code and return a list of custom errors.

It's a simple REST API that uses the `ASP.NET Core` framework that uses [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) for the ORM.
